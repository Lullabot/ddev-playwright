description: Use when the user asks to review, refine, improve, interrogate, pressure-test, or update an existing Strikethroo plan by plan ID in this repository — triggers include refine plan, improve plan, review plan, red-team the plan, update plan. Do not use to create a new plan, to generate tasks, or for generic brainstorming outside Strikethroo.

# st-refine-plan

## Inputs

The user supplies the numeric plan ID conversationally, plus any optional refinement notes.

## Operating Procedure

### 1. Locate the strikethroo root

Run `scripts/find-strikethroo-root.cjs` from the user's working directory. If
it exits non-zero, stop and ask the user to run `npx strikethroo init`.

Treat the path it prints as `<root>` for every subsequent step.

Delegated execution workers skip this step and do not emit update notices.

Run `scripts/check-for-updates.cjs "<root>"` as a separate command using this
skill's script path. Keep the user's working directory. Read the one JSON line
on stdout. When `notice` is present, retain its exact text for the final
user-facing response. Never pause for permission and never run an update.

### 2. Resolve the plan

Run `scripts/validate-plan-blueprint.cjs <plan-id> planFile` for the plan
file's absolute path. Another field name prints that field instead.

If the script exits non-zero, stop and ask the user to confirm the plan ID.
Do not guess a different ID.

### 3. Load project context

Read `<root>/config/STRIKETHROO.md` for this project's directory conventions.
Read `<root>/config/hooks/PRE_PLAN.md` and execute its instructions before
proceeding. Read `<root>/config/templates/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`; the refined plan
must still conform to it. Read `<root>/config/shared/clarification-gate.md`
and apply it in the Clarification Loop.

### 4. Baseline Review

Read the entire plan end-to-end without modifying it. Record every
contradiction and every gap you find under these lenses:

- **Context gaps**: missing background, assumptions, competing priorities.
- **Technical gaps**: underspecified architecture, unclear interfaces, missing diagrams.
- **Risk gaps**: untracked risks, missing mitigations, hand-wavy success metrics.
- **Scope issues**: gold-plating, ambiguous boundaries, requirements that
  contradict YAGNI.

Document each one as `{section, issue, severity, proposed fix}`.

### 5. Clarification Loop

**Default to Interactive Clarification.** Switch to **Autonomous
Clarification** only when one of these holds without interpretation:

- The user's request names the mode by intent, with a keyword such as "auto",
  "autonomous", "non-interactive", "without asking me", or "don't ask".
- An upstream orchestrator (for example the `st-full-workflow` skill) declared
  autonomous operation for this invocation in the prompt passed to this skill.

Otherwise use Interactive Clarification, even when the user's presence is
uncertain. Do not infer autonomous mode from indirect signals such as terse
prompts, scripted-looking input, or absence of recent user messages.

Either branch starts from the gaps documented in the Baseline Review. Think
harder before raising one: only put forward an uncertainty you can cite.
Append every resolution to the plan document's "Plan Clarifications" table in
its existing question/answer format, marking each entry's source.

#### Interactive Clarification

Follow the clarification cadence in `<root>/config/shared/clarification-gate.md`.

1. Ask one question at a time per that cadence; never dump them as a batch.
2. Prefill each question with the most plausible answer, and always offer an
   "Other / open-ended" option for the nuances you did not anticipate.
3. **STOP AND ASK**: Put each question to the user and halt execution to await
   their input. Do not simulate the user's response. Do not proceed to step 6
   until you have received explicit answers and confirmed the resolved scope.
4. Record a question the user cannot or will not answer as unresolved, with
   mitigation notes so downstream assistants know the risk, then proceed with
   the available context.
5. Re-evaluate whether the answers opened new gaps. If so, repeat this loop.

#### Autonomous Clarification

1. Resolve each gap from the codebase, its configuration files, its
   documentation, and the project's established patterns. Fall back to a
   reasonable assumption only where those do not answer it.
2. Mark each resolution's source as "auto-resolved" (confirmed in the
   codebase) or "assumption" (best-effort guess, with its rationale).
3. Record a gap you can resolve neither way as unresolved, with mitigation
   notes so downstream assistants know the risk.

### 6. Refinement Implementation

Refine the plan in place, at the path step 2 resolved.

1. **Maintain Identity**: Keep the existing `id` and directory. Never allocate
   a new plan ID and never move the plan.
2. **Structure Compliance**: Keep the plan conformant to
   `<root>/config/templates/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`, adding any missing section.
3. **Content Updates**:
   - Refresh the executive summary against the clarifications.
   - Update the architectural sections, diagrams, and risk mitigations the
     gaps named.
   - Trim scope creep that is not explicitly required.
   - Point each affected section back at the Q&A table.
4. **Net-New Sections**: Add a subsection the plan now needs (Decision Log,
   Data Contracts) under `Notes`, clearly labeled.
5. **Change Log**: Append to `Notes` a bullet stating what this session
   changed, such as
   `- 2025-03-16: Clarified auth flow tokens and updated architecture diagram`.

### 7. Run the post-plan hook

Execute `<root>/config/hooks/POST_PLAN.md`.

When the retained update `notice` is present, append that exact sentence after
the structured summary block, or after your final response when this skill emits
no summary block. Nothing may follow the notice.

## Failure Modes

- **A helper script fails unexpectedly.** Surface stderr to the user and
  stop — do not fall back to manual path discovery.
